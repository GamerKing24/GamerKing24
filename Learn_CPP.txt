Hmmm So I am a new learner and Currently I am learning C++.

Basic Structure:
  #include<iostream>

  int main(){
  return 0;
  }




So every single line of code you write is written above return 0; and under the Curly Brackets. And you put a ; after every line.





THE PRINT FUNCTION

So to print something you write cout and then two  << and then Double Quotes and content between them "..." and then put a ;.


For eg:
  #include<iostream>

  int main(){
      std::cout<<"Hello World";
      return 0;
  }
  
  
Here std is a namespace.
